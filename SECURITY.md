# Security Policy

We take security seriously.

This code should normally run sandboxed, but as it is in the editor and has access
to your editor's content, we will respond promptly to any credible security concern.

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest release.  Everyone should run the latest to ensure that
they are benefitting from any fixes, including security related.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security reports may be submitted via GitHub issues, or if a confidential report
is required, send an email to garrett@damore.org.
